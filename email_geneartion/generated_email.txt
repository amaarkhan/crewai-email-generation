Subject: Sick Leave Request - Amaar Khan (20-CS-123)

Dear Dr. [Course Instructor's Name],

This email is to formally request a two-day sick leave from your classes. I am currently suffering from a viral infection and have been advised by my physician to rest for two days to facilitate a full recovery.

My name is Amaar Khan, my roll number is 20-CS-123, and I am a sixth-semester BSCS student.  This absence will affect my attendance on July 5th and July 6th, 2025. I will make every effort to obtain notes from classmates and complete any missed assignments promptly upon my return.  I will also reach out to you during my absence if any urgent matters arise regarding coursework.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,

Amaar Khan

BSCS, 6th Semester
