Subject: Sick Leave Request - Amaar Khan (20-CS-123)

Dear Professor [Course Instructor's Name],

This email is to formally request a two-day sick leave from your classes. I am currently suffering from a viral infection and have been advised by my physician to rest for two days to facilitate a full recovery.

My name is Amaar Khan, my roll number is 20-CS-123, and I am a sixth-semester BSCS student.  This absence will affect my attendance on July 5th and 6th, 2025. I will make every effort to promptly catch up on any missed lectures, assignments, and announcements upon my return.  I will also reach out to classmates to obtain any necessary notes.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration of this request.

Sincerely,

Amaar Khan

BSCS, 6th Semester
